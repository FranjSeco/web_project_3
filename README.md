# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

## Description.

### Single website page that offers information about a trip from coast to coast in the USA.

## Technologies used.

### I have used HTML and CSS (Flexbox, Grid and Media Queries) to build this project. The file structure follows the BEM methodology.

## Plans for the future.

### The responsiveness might need some adjustment in order to fix breakpoints. In the future, once we learn JavaScript, we could add some functonality to the nav bar in order to give the option of choosing the language.
